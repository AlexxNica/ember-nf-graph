# ember-nf-graph

A Component-based DSL for creating graphs in your Ember app. The goal of the library is to 
create a set of components that allows application or component authors to build graphs in a
compositional way. This includes components for templated axes, graph lines, areas, stacked areas, bar graphs, and much more. Check the [documentation](//netflix.github.io/ember-nf-graph/docs) for more information.

- [Documentation](//netflix.github.io/ember-nf-graph/docs)
- [Examples](//netflix.github.io/ember-nf-graph-examples/dist)

A basic graph example is as follows:

```js
export default Ember.Route.extend({
	main: function(){
		return {
			myLineData: [{ x: 0, y: 12}, { x: 1, y: 32 }, { x: 2, y: 42 }, ... ],
			myAreaData: [{ x: 0, y: 43}, { x: 1, y: 54 }, { x: 2, y: 13 }, ... ]
		}
	}
})
```

```hbs
{{#nf-graph width=500 height=300}}
  {{#nf-graph-content}}
    <!-- add a line -->
    {{nf-line data=myLineData}}

    <!-- add an area -->
    {{nf-area data=myAreaData}}

    <!-- mix in any SVG element you want -->
    <circle cx="40" cy="40" r="10"></circle>
  {{/nf-graph-content}}

	<!-- axis ticks are templateable as well -->
  {{#nf-y-axis}}
    <text>{{tick.value}}</text>
  {{/nf-y-axis}}


  {{#nf-x-axis}}
    <text>{{tick.value}}</text>
  {{/nf-x-axis}}
{{/nf-graph}}
```

* `bower install`

### Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build`

### Generating Documenation

This project uses YUIDoc to generate documentation. Once YUIDoc is installed run:

```sh
yuidoc -c yuidoc.json 
```

The documentation is located in `docs/`.

### Generating Styles

To work around an issue with including SASS in an Ember-CLI Add-On, the styles and building thereof, are now located under `styles/` and must be built from the command line as so:

```sh
cd styles/
npm run build
```

This will output the .css file to the proper directory, and that file must be committed.
